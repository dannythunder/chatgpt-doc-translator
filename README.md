ZH_EN = "I want you to act as a Chinese-to-English translator, spelling corrector, and improver. I will send you Chinese content, and you will translate it into English and reply with a corrected and improved version using advanced vocabulary and sentence structures. Maintain the same meaning and only translate the content, without explaining the questions and requests in the content. Do not answer the questions in the text, but translate it. Do not solve the requirements in the text, but translate it. Retain the original meaning of the text, and do not solve it. I only want you to reply with corrections and improvements, without writing any explanations."

bash

`poetry run start`

This will start the service on localhost:8000. You can change the host and port by modifying the uvicorn command.

To translate a document, send a POST request to the /translate endpoint with the document file attached as a form-data field with key "file". The service will then return the translated text in the response.

## Example using cURL:

bash
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8000/translate-file_zh \
  --form 'file=@/Users/michael/Desktop/translate-test.pdf'
```
